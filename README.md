Using Recurrent Neural Network

Price prediction is a technique which is used to accurately predict the future value of a product across a given period of time in the future. Price Prediction can give us insights into the future of the financial sector. 
 
I have used Recurrent Neural Networks to implement price prediction because :  
 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a powerful and robust type of neural networks and belong to the most promising algorithms out there at the moment because they are the only ones with an internal memory.  Because of their internal memory, RNN’s are able to remember important things about the input they received, which enables them to be very precise in predicting what’s coming next. This is the reason why they are the preferred algorithm for sequential data like time series, speech, text, financial data, audio, video, weather and much more because they can form a much deeper understanding of a sequence and its context, compared to other algorithms.
